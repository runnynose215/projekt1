  <h1><center>Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel <u>The Defense</u> or <u>Luzhin's Defense</center></u></h1>
	<p></p>
  <p>Although lesser known, <u>The Defense</u> by Vladimir Nabokov is equally representative of the author’s theme of the haunted genius. Its protagonist, Aleksandr Ivanovich Luzhin, is a former chess prodigy and Russian émigré living in Europe who is approaching middle age. His obsession with chess helps him escape two major traumatic events in childhood: forced removal from his home country and financial exploitation by a chess manager who abandoned him once his celebrity began to fade. Unfortunately, chess also prevents Luzhin from fully engaging with society in a normal, healthy way. Eventually his inability to escape his childhood horrors and successfully transition into adulthood cause his demise.</p>
